## What is DeepLint?
<<<<<<< HEAD

DeepLint is open-source cloud security and governance tool that helps you find and fix cloud misconfigurations, reduce cost, and stay compliant. 

DeepLint can work with any Cloud, infrastructure, and services, as well as Infrastructure-as-Code, and support multi and hybrid cloud environments. 

## Why DeepLint?

Cloud brings agility and scalability, but also bring chaos. Cloud misconfigurations can cause companies trillion dollars in losses. A simple configuration mistake may turn down your entire application infrastructure or leave idle resources that cost you a fortune. With Multi-Cloud and DevOps movement, maintaining cloud security and compliance is more challenging and essential.

Existing security solutions are inadequate and insufficient. First,  only have limited checks on specific Cloud resources based on common industry practices and have no-easy-way to extend, inadequate for multi-cloud environments. Second, the lack of a reliable and consistent way to create and enforce business-specific security and compliant policies in high-dynamic environments. 

**Cloud security and governance needs a new approach.**

## How DeepLint works

DeepLint adopts the Security-as-Code methodology, empowering you to define, codify, and build enforceable security packages per your best practices, standards, and policies for any Cloud. You can easily share your security packages across the organization.  Plus, DeepLint provides pre-curated security packages based on common industry practices. 

DeepLint allows you to flexibly use any security packages to check a single cloud environment or your entire cloud infrastructure. Configuration files describe to DeepLint security packages needed. DeepLint orchestrates the workflow -- take a snapshot of cloud resources configurations and usage, apply rules to find problems, and generate actionable fixing advice. 

You can easily embed DeepLint into your existing CI/CD pipelines and integrate with other security services to automate DevOps with one unified toolchain.

## Key Features
### Security as Code
Codify security in a unified workflow - collect resources, find problems, and fix, per your best practices, standards, and policies.
### Self-Contained Bundling
Bundle and share security required everything - scanners, rules, and actions, into a versioned and enforceable Pack.
### Pre-curated Packages
Elevate cloud security posture instantly with pre-curated security packages based on common industry practices.
### Hybrid and Multi-Cloud
Configure and manage any security packages to check a single cloud environment or your entire hybrid or multi-cloud infrastructure.
### Reliable Enforcement
Snapshot configurations of cloud resources for auditing and visibility. Find and fix mistakes and policy violations consistently and repeatedly.
### Auto DevSecOps
Embed into DevOps pipelines and integrate with third-party security services seamlessly and effortlessly.

## Next steps
=======

DeepLint is an open-source Cloud Security-as-Code framework that enables you to build, enforce, and manage security workflows as code to find, fix, and prevent costly mistakes in cloud configurations. 

## Why DeepLint?

Organizations move to Cloud for its agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, Cloud can also bring chaos. A naive configuration mistake can turn down your entire infrastructure or leave idle resources that cost you a fortune.
With DevOps, cloud configurations are being continuously updated, which makes staying secure and compliant event more challenging and urgent.

Existing solutions are 
- slowing down the development
- limited on supported Cloud and checking coverage
- difficult to customize and extend
- usually very pricey

**Cloud security needs a new approach.** 

DeepLint adopts the Security-as-Code methodology, empowering you to define and codify security workflows for any cloud applications at the beginning of a project, keep them in a source code repository
, and run automatically within DevOps pipelines.  

With DeepLint, you can secure and optimize any Cloud, infrastructure or services, and Infrastructure-as-Code templates through the entire DevOps life cycle, without slowing down development and growth.

DeepLint helps you protect cloud environments from: 
- Security threats
- Data leakage
- Compliance violations
- IAM challenges
- Idle resources
- More

## How it works
### Build
DeepLine organizes the security workflows into the **Package**, a runnable and self-contained security enforcement unit. Each package is described by a YAML spec file, abstracting security workflows into three steps:
scan, check, and fix.  
### Configure
DeepLint uses a YAML configuration file to configure and manage packages. You can build the customized package from scratch or use the pre-curated industrial best practices for a quick bootstrap. 
### Run
DeepLint then orchestrates the workflow
Scan and snapshot the resources configurations.
Enforce ruleset to identify potential problems.
Apply fixes on your command.
You can embed DeepLint into existing CI/CD pipelines to automate security checks on any code or configurations changes and before/after each deployment. 

## Key Features
### Security-as-Code

Codified security workflows allow repeated and consistent usage, and can be managed as code - version control, peer review, and sharing.

### DevSecOps

Embed security workflows into DevOps pipelines to secure and optimize Cloud without slowing down development and growth.


### Multi-Cloud

Use one unified tool to check multiple Cloud and Infrastructure-as-Code. Quickly elevate cloud security posture with pre-curated packages.

### Collaboration

Package and share your security best practices within the team. Automatically fix founded problems with shared fixing actions.
