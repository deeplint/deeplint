## What is DeepLint?

DeepLint is an open-source Cloud Security-as-Code framework that enables you to build, enforce, and manage security workflows as code to find, fix, and prevent costly mistakes in cloud configurations. 

## Why DeepLint?

Organizations move to Cloud for its agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, Cloud can also bring chaos. A naive configuration mistake can turn down your entire infrastructure or leave idle resources that cost you a fortune.
With DevOps, cloud configurations are being continuously updated, which makes staying secure and compliant event more challenging and urgent.

Existing solutions are 
- slowing down the development
- limited on supported Cloud and checking coverage
- difficult to customize and extend
- usually very pricey

**Cloud security needs a new approach.** 

DeepLint adopts the Security-as-Code methodology, empowering you to define and codify security workflows for any cloud applications at the beginning of a project, keep them in a source code repository
, and run automatically within DevOps pipelines.  

With DeepLint, you can secure and optimize any Cloud, infrastructure or services, and Infrastructure-as-Code templates through the entire DevOps life cycle, without slowing down development and growth.

DeepLint helps you protect cloud environments from: 
- Security threats
- Data leakage
- Compliance violations
- IAM challenges
- Idle resources
- More

## How it works
### Build
DeepLine organizes the security workflows into the **Package**, a runnable and self-contained security enforcement unit. Each package is described by a YAML spec file, abstracting security workflows into three steps:
scan, check, and fix.  
### Configure
DeepLint uses a YAML configuration file to configure and manage packages. You can build the customized package from scratch or use the pre-curated industrial best practices for a quick bootstrap. 
### Run
DeepLint then orchestrates the workflow
Scan and snapshot the resources configurations.
Enforce ruleset to identify potential problems.
Apply fixes on your command.
You can embed DeepLint into existing CI/CD pipelines to automate security checks on any code or configurations changes and before/after each deployment. 

## Key Features
### Security-as-Code

Codified security workflows allow repeated and consistent usage, and can be managed as code - version control, peer review, and sharing.

### DevSecOps

Embed security workflows into DevOps pipelines to secure and optimize Cloud without slowing down development and growth.


### Multi-Cloud

Use one unified tool to check multiple Cloud and Infrastructure-as-Code. Quickly elevate cloud security posture with pre-curated packages.

### Collaboration

Package and share your security best practices within the team. Automatically fix founded problems with shared fixing actions.
