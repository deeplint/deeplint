## What is DeepLint?
[DeepLint](https://deeplint.com) is an open-source Security-as-Code framework for securing and optimizing any cloud, infrastructure or services. 

With DeepLint, you can build,enforce and share security workflows as code to find, fix and prevent costly mistakes in any cloud configurations, 
or use pre-curated industrial best practices to quickly elevate cloud security posture.

## Why DeepLint?

Organizations are quickly moving to Cloud for its agility, scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, cloud also brings chaos. 

### Security as Code

Codify security workflows as code for a repeated and consistent usage, as well as version control, peer review and sharing.

### DevSecOps
Embed security checks into DevOps pipelines to enforce high standards without slowing down development.

### Multi-Cloud
Use one unified tool to check multiple cloud accounts and infrastructure as code with pluggable security packages.
