## What is DeepLint?

[DeepLint](https://deeplint.com) is an open-source Cloud Security-as-Code framework for securing and optimizing any cloud, infrastructure, or services. With DeepLint, you can build, enforce, and share security workflows as code to find, fix, and prevent costly mistakes in cloud configurations. 

With pluggable security packages, DeepLint can be easily extended to check multiple cloud accounts and work with any cloud types, from IaaS to SaaS, as well as Infrastructure-as-Code.

## Why DeepLint?

Organizations are quickly moving to Cloud for agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, Cloud can also bring chaos. A simple configuration mistake can cause data leakage or leave idle resources that cost you a fortune. 

DeepLint adopts the Security-as-Code approach and aims to provide a unified and extendable cloud security tool to help organizations better utilize Cloud without slowing down product development and business growth.

### Security as Code

Codify security workflows for repeated and consistent usage. Manage security as code - version control, peer review, and sharing.

### Extendable

Package and share your security best practices within the team. Use pre-curated security packages to elevate cloud security posture quickly.

### Multi-Cloud

Use one unified tool to check multiple Cloud and Infrastructure-as-Code with easy-to-configure security packages.

### DevSecOps

Embed security workflows into DevOps pipelines to automate cloud security without slowing down development.
