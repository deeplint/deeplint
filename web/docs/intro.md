## What is DeepLint?

DeepLint is open-source cloud security and governance tool that helps you find and fix cloud misconfigurations, reduce cost, and stay compliant. 

DeepLint can work with any Cloud, infrastructure, and services, as well as Infrastructure-as-Code, and support multi and hybrid cloud environments. 

## Why DeepLint?

Cloud brings agility and scalability, but also bring chaos. Cloud misconfigurations can cause companies trillion dollars in losses. A simple configuration mistake may turn down your entire application infrastructure or leave idle resources that cost you a fortune. With Multi-Cloud and DevOps movement, maintaining cloud security and compliance is more challenging and essential.

Existing security solutions are inadequate and insufficient. First,  only have limited checks on specific Cloud resources based on common industry practices and have no-easy-way to extend, inadequate for multi-cloud environments. Second, the lack of a reliable and consistent way to create and enforce business-specific security and compliant policies in high-dynamic environments. 

**Cloud security and governance needs a new approach.**

## How DeepLint works

DeepLint adopts the Security-as-Code methodology, empowering you to define, codify, and build enforceable security packages per your best practices, standards, and policies for any Cloud. You can easily share your security packages across the organization.  Plus, DeepLint provides pre-curated security packages based on common industry practices. 

DeepLint allows you to flexibly use any security packages to check a single cloud environment or your entire cloud infrastructure. Configuration files describe to DeepLint security packages needed. DeepLint orchestrates the workflow -- take a snapshot of cloud resources configurations and usage, apply rules to find problems, and generate actionable fixing advice. 

You can easily embed DeepLint into your existing CI/CD pipelines and integrate with other security services to automate DevOps with one unified toolchain.

The key features of DeepLint are:

### Codify
Codify security into three steps  - collect resources, find problems, and fix. Manage security as code - version control, peer review, and sharing.

### Package
Package security required everything - resource scanners, checking rules, and fixing actions into a versioned and enforceable Package.

### Share
Use predefined security packages curated based on common industry practices. Share your best practices within the team or with the world.

### Configure
Choose and apply any security packages to check a single cloud environment or your entire cloud infrastructure in one configuration file.

### Enforce
Snapshot configurations of cloud resources for auditing and visibility. Find and fix mistakes and policy violations consistently and repeatedly. 

### Automate
Easily embed into CI/CD pipelines and integrate with existing security services to automate DevSecOps with one unified toolchain.
